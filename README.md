This repository contains the code, presentaitons, and technical reports associated with the Cornerstone 2 Semester long Deisgn Project. 

The assigned task for this project was to  solving an open-ended design project developed out of a needs assessment of our choice. The project was meant to utilize robotic elements and automations using various Arduino 
components, as well as sself-designed 3D printed, lasercut, and soldered components. The overarching goal of the design project was to follow the Engineering Design Cycle to address a problem using these resources. 

For this task, our team chose to adress the issue of hand dexterity which affects multiple populations, including the elderly, children, and induviduals recovering from hand injuries. Our goal was to design a product 
that could help improve hand dexterity by training the hand and building up the muscles and coordination ascociated with dexterity. In order to achieve this, we developed a handheld device that follows the game 'Simon Says'. 
Our itteration of the game incldued 10 LED lights that lit up in a randomized sequence, rather than the 4 on the currently sold 'Simon' game. In order to move forward with the sequence, the user had to press the button 
corresponding with the correct light. 

In developing this project, we utilized Arduino IDE to write the code controlling the game. Additionally, we used Arduino components to hardwire the device, as well as 2D & 3D modeling software (Solidworks & Autocad) in order 
to design and fabricate the shell that housed our hardwiring. The final product, as shown in the technical report and presentaions, was showcased at a grade-wide Design Expo where attendees could try out our device.
